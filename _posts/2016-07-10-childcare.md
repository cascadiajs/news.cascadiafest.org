We are excited to provide affordable child care for parents and guardians attending CascadiaFest. Please read below for information on the provider, the costs and how to sign-up!

### Services

Child care is being provided by the wonderful people at [Bigtime Kid Care](http://www.bigtimekidcare.com/). Feel free to check out their website for more information about the care they provide and their child care professionals. Care will take place inside Semiahmoo Resort in a room dedicated to this purpose.

We will make sure enough care givers are on-hand to ensure the following child/caregiver ratios: 

* 0-1 years old = 2 children / caregiver
* 1-4 years old = 3 children / caregiver
* 4+ years old = 6 children / caregiver

### Price

Child care will be available every day of the conference (August 3-5) from 9am - 10pm. The day will be divided into two time slots, one during the day and one in the evening. Prices are below (per child, per day):

* 9am - 5pm = $60
* 5pm - 10pm = $40

### How to RSVP

If you would like to reserve a childcare slot at CascadiaFest, please email Stephanie Michael ([stephanie@bigtimekidcare.com](mailto:stephanie@bigtimekidcare.com)) **no later than Friday, July 22nd**. We cannot accommodate walk-ins, so please make sure you're registered prior to the deadline. Stephanie will need the following information from you:

* Name and age of each child.
* A phone number for you.
* Time slots (day & time slot) that you'd like to reserve care for.
* Any notes for the caretakers.
