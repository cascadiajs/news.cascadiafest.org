Weâ€™re delighted to be offering not just a Hacker Train this year, but also a Hacker Bus! The train will run from Portland to Seattle, and we have private busses that will get you directly to Semiahmoo from either Seattle or Vancouver, BC. Book your spots soon, as there are limited seats available!
