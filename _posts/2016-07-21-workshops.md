We all have a million ideas that may either scratch a particular itch or be the “next Pokemon Go.” Together, let’s work through how we can use an API-driven approach to take our idea from nothing to amazing. We’ll assume you have some web experience, but other than that, we will start at the beginning. You’ll learn: why you may want an API and what it means to make it public; how to design and plan your model; and then how to put it all together: create, run, manage, secure and deploy your APIs. With the power of LoopBack, you can create an API layer in moments, but it’s how you make it awesome that counts.
