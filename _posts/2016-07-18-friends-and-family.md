## Friends and Family Track

Back by popular demand! Please bear with us as we work to make CascadiaFest fun for the whole family, and feel free to give us feedback; that way, anything we miss this year can hopefully be added next time!

As part of the CascadiaFest group, you will already have access to Semiahmoo’s pool, health center, tennis courts, basketball courts, ping pong tables, beach toys, volleyball courts, croquet, horseshoes, bocce ball, and numerous other activities on the property, free of charge.  

There’s also an on-site Championship Golf course and a full-service Spa; prices and promotions for these are available at [Semiahmoo’s website](http://www.semiahmoo.com).

But in addition to the amazing amenities available on site, you may want to meet some new people, make some new friends, and get out and explore!  To help with that, we are organizing the following activities.  Sign up for one or all - we’ve tried to make at least one family friendly event each day.  But please note, for the following items, you will need a Family and Friends ticket in order to participate.

During July, grey whales and Orcas are prolific in the waters off the Washington Coast, as the follow the salmon runs in the area. We’ll depart on a high speed vessel, the Triton, to explore wildlife with a knowledgeable marine naturalist and our captain. Orcas, humpbacks, grays, minkes, porpoises and more amazing wildlife are known to be found in ocean surrounding Semiahmoo.

We’ll spend 4 hours out exploring and return to the Plover Dock of Semiahmoo Resort at 4:30.

The northwest corner of Washington falls in the Puget Sound viticultural area, the only AVA west of the Cascade Mountains. This afternoon, we’ll be tasting both wine made from grapes grown in the Puget Sound Viticultural Area, as well as wines that are made locally, but with grapes grown from viticultural areas on the other side of the mountains. And, for a real special treat, we’ll also stop by a distillery that uses apples from its local orchards to produce the most amazing vodkas and gins. Be sure to try their raspberry vodka with lemonade - it’s superb!
